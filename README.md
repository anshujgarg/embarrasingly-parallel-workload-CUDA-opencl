# embarrasingly-parallel-workload-CUDA-opencl
Set of embarassingly parallel (data parallel) workloads written in CUDA and OpenCL


# Corresponding research paper
These workloads were used in the research paper:
"FaaSter: Accelerated Functions-as-a-Service with Heterogeneous GPUs"
https://doi.org/10.1109/HiPC53243.2021.00057

# Description
Each workload has a CUDA and OpenCL version.
A "datagen.c" file is present to generate the input data for the
workload.
